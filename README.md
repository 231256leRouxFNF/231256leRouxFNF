## Contributions & Streak
You shared an example (Image 1) showing a streak/summary card. I added two common widgets below that replicate that information:

- Streak card (total contributions, current streak, longest streak)
- Contribution activity graph (calendar-style)

Paste / use these image URLs directly — they generate dynamic images for your username.

<p align="center">
  <!-- Streak stats (matches the layout in your screenshot) -->
  <img alt="GitHub Streak" src="https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=231256leRouxFNF&theme=dark&fire=FF8C00&ring=0077C6&dates=true" />

  <!-- Activity graph (contribution calendar) -->
  <br /><br />
  <img alt="Contribution Graph" src="https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=231256leRouxFNF&theme=github-dark&area=true&hide_border=true" />
</p>

Notes on these widgets
- The streak card replicates the look in your Image 1 (dark theme, orange fire color, blue ring). You can tweak parameters (theme, fire, ring) in the URL to change colors.
- The activity graph shows your daily contributions calendar similar to GitHub's contribution heatmap.
- Both images are dynamic; they fetch live data for your username and will update automatically.

Notes & next steps:
- I added the streak and activity graph widgets to match the example you uploaded (Image 1). They use public image generators that read your GitHub activity.
- If you prefer different colors, layout, or want the contribution summary card embedded in a different spot, tell me which color values or placement and I’ll update the README accordingly.
- If you'd like, I can replace the placeholder mockups with actual screenshots if you upload them or point to their URLs.
